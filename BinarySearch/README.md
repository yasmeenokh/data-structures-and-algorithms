### Insert and shift an array in middle index.

### Approach & Efficiency

Approach & Efficiency : break down the problem into smaller problems, step by step build the full function, it didn't take long, it took about 1 hour min.

I took the approach of finding the number first if it exists in input array, then if did find it's index and return it's index.
