# FizzBuzz Tree : 

Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
Return a new tree.

## Language: `JavaScript`

- **Run every possible test** - `npm test`
- **Run a test for a data structure** - `npm test fizzBuzz.test.js `
